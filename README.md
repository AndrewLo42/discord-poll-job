# Schedule Polls
- Sends a message every week for a poll to see when is a good day for the week for people to hangout
- Set to send every Sunday and we as a collective will determine what day we should meet up
- Created with hanging out for Magic the Gathering in mind
## To Do?
- Assign roles for people who voted for the day that won and ping them the day of?
- Create a calendar invite link of some sort, but maybe that's too extra lol
